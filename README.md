# get-next-line

## Context

Currently, I am selected as a formal student by 42 London after 26-day intense piscine. I have passed my libft project which is circle 0. Now the next project is about file handling input/output in C. To do it differently, I tried to plan for my project in a detailed way, especially for breaking down project into manageable tasks.

## Goal

1. Understand File Input/output basic (Days 1-5)
	- Specific: Focus on the fundamental concepts of file input/output in C
	- Measurable: Complete online tutorials or exercises covering basic file operations, such as opening, reading, and closing files
	- Actionable: Write a simple C program that opens a file, reads its contents, and prints them to the console
2. Explore File Stream
	- Specifics: Dive deeper into the concept of file streams
	- Measurable: Read relevant sections in C programming books or documentation about file streams
	- Actionable: implement a program that uses both `fopen` and `open` functions to handle file input
3. Differentiate `FILE` and normal `fd`
	- Specifics: Understand the distinctions between `FILE` and a regular file descriptor (`fd`)
	- Measurable: Write a comparative analysis highlighting the key differences and use cases of `FILE` and file descriptors
4. Advanced Understanding of File I/O
	- Goals gain an advanced understanding of file I/O concepts beyond the project requirements
	- Actionable: Explore concepts such as file modes, file permissions, error handing in file I/O operations, and seek to understand how the operating system manages file data
5. Dynamic memory management mastery
	- Goal: Master Dynamic memory management using `malloc` and `free`
	- Actionable: practice allocating and freeing memor in various scenarios
	- Experiment with different allocation strategies, handle edge cases, and ensure proper error checking 
6. Error Handling Practices
	- goal: Develop effective error-handing practice for file I/O operations
	- Actionable: implement robust error-checking mechanisms in you "get_next_line" project. Consider all possible failure scenarios and implement graceful error handling using retrun values and errno
7. Code Modularity and Readability
	- Goal: Emphasize code modularity and readability
	- Actionable: Refactor your code into modular functions with clear responsibilities. ensure that each function does one thing well and is easy to understand. strive for a clean and readable codebase
8. Testing strategies
	- Goal: Develop effective testing strategies
	- Actionable: Create comprehensive test case for your `get_next_line` function include tests for various file types, edge cases, and unexpected scenarios. consider automating your tests for ease of future validation
9. Documentation Best Practices
	- Goal: Adhere to documentation best practices
	- Actionable: keep your code well-documented with clear comments explaining the purpose of each function and any intricate parts of your implementation
	- ensure your README file provides comprehensive instructions on how to use your "get_next_line" function
10. Version Control Proficiency
	- Goal: gain proficiency in version control using git
	- Actionable: use git for version control during the development of your project. 
	- practice commiting changes, branching, and merging to maintain a well-organised project history
11. Explore Advanced File I/O concepts
	- Goal: Explore advanced file I/O concepts not covered in the project requirements
	- Actionable: Investigate topics like memory-mapped files, asynchronous file I/O, or other advanced file handling techniques. while not directly applicable to the project, expanding your knowledge will deepen your understanding of file operations
